Achieved **94% accuracy** by implementing a neural network to recognize the human face emotions (*7 types*) in real-time. Extended the project to recommend songs (from [spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)) and movies (from [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)) based on the detected mood.
