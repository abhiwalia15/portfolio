**Project:** Autonomous Logistics Inspection 
**Tech Stack:** _Python, R, AWS [DynamoDB, SageMaker], Git, Slack, OpenCV, PyTorch, NLP_

- Executed back-end pipeline for automatic inspection of cargo containers by collecting raw images, applying OpenCV and NumPy to up-scale images (up to 4x) and extracting useful information from the images in real-time

- Collected data and automated the annotation to apply object detection to detect the containers using transfer learning with the PyTorch framework (99.2% accuracy).

- Applied image localization and segmentation to detect the edges of containers and extract the region of interest to upscale the pixel qualities using OpenCV and computer vision technologies.

- Implemented image-to-text conversion using NLP and regex expressions to extract helpful information from the images and stored the result in AWS DynamoDB.
