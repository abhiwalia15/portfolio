Hello! Interestingly, I am a graduate student at the [University of Windsor](https://www.uwindsor.ca/), pursuing my Master's in Applied Computing Artificial Intelligence Stream. I am a passionate **Data Scientist** and a **Freelance Technical Writer**. 

I'm currently working as a Technical Writer for **OpenMined** on their [PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft) library. My responsibilty includes auditing, designing and delivering readme pages, tutorials, and other docs. 

I love optimizing machine learning models and making valuable predictions out of data. I also share my thoughts and knowledge with others by writing [Articles](https://medium.com/@waliamrinal/list/opensource-blogs-b68cf331d37d) on Data Science, Machine Learning, Cybersecurity, Quant AI, Open-Source and more.

I have been awarded as [OpenMined Featured Contributor](https://blog.openmined.org/), multiple times winner for Analytics Vidhya [Blogathons](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6920431433605885952/) and top [GitHub](https://github.com/abhiwalia15?tab=overview&from=2020-12-01&to=2020-12-31) user in India in the year 2020 by making 3300+ contributions to 300+ repositories.
