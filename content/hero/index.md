I'm a Data Scientist with a goal-driven creative mindset and a passion for learning and innovating.

Currently pursuing my Master's in [Applied Computing](https://www.uwindsor.ca/graduate-studies/305/applied-computing) - Artificial Intelligence Stream from the University of Windsor and working as a Technical Writer at [OpenMined](https://www.openmined.org/).

Outside work, I occasionally provide freelance gigs in Data Science related services on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrinal-walia-b0981b158/). Off-screen, I draft my thoughts on [Medium](https://medium.com/me/lists)!
